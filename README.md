# Calibration
This is Calibration gcode for 3d Printers!
We included multiple 3d printers.
GCode will move extruder around. You will then align Bed!
When you align it on one side, you click a button and Extruder will move to another place!

# Testing
If you have a 3d printer at home and you need to calibrate it, then use gcode for your 3d printer.
If it worked for you and if it didn't, then please write in issues.
If you have a suggestion for 3d printer, then please write in issues. We sadly can't write calibration for SLA 3d printers.

# Branches
There are master and beta branches! Master includes only tested and confirmed ones. Beta includes all of confirmed and unconfirmed 3d printer calibration G-codes.
